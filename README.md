## Project Insights

- Total Bookings: 20,407 (July 2024) | Revenue: ₹7M
- Prime Sedan generated highest booking value (₹1.67M) and distance (44.97K km).
- Mini had the highest customer rating (4.02/5).
- Cancellation Analysis: 34.56% cancellations due to customer reasons (e.g., change of plans).

## Final COnclusion
To improve OLA's ride-sharing services, the company should focus on reducing the 28.1% cancellation rate by implementing measures such as penalties for frequent cancellations, better address validation, and driver training programs to handle common issues like AC complaints. Revenue and customer retention can be enhanced through loyalty programs for top customers and dynamic pricing for high-demand vehicles like Prime Sedan and SUV. Service quality should be prioritized by expanding the Mini fleet (highest-rated at 4.02) and monitoring driver performance, particularly for Bike/E-Bike services (lowest-rated at 3.98).
